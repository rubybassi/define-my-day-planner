# jQuery: Define My Day Planner

## Background

This project is my attempt of creating a day scheduler using jQuery, moment.js and local storage. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically created HTML and CSS powered by jQuery code. 

The user can add event items in the respective timeblock and save; upon page refresh the event data is retrieved and displayed, allowing the user to view past inputs. 

The time blocks are also dynamically colour-coded for past, present and future events using the moment.js library and jQuery conditional statements.

Comments were added throughout the Javascript file, highlighting the key coding blocks and evidence of console.log testing.
